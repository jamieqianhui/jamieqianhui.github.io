Are you looking to buy a private residential property in Singapore and wish to get a sensing of the prevailing market conditions? Retrieving public datasets available on URA API reference webpage, I built a dashboard to analyse the **demand and supply for Singapore's Private Residential Property Sales in 1H2019**. Specifically, I dissected the dataset to identify the following trends: 1) Top 10 Sales Volume and Highest Median Price PSF by Project and District, 2) Sales Price PSF by Market Segment across period, 3) Take up rate (% percentage of Sold Units versus Total Units Launched for Sale) and 4) Median Price PSF by geographical location and individual project. Click on read more to view the dashboard!
