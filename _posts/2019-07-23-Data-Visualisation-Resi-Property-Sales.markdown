Are you looking to buy a private residential property in Singapore and wish to get a sensing of the market performance? Retrieving public datasets available on URA API reference site, I built a dashboard to analyse the **demand and supply for Singapore's Private Residential Property Sales in 1H2019**. Specifically, I dissected the dataset to identify the following trends: 1) Top 10 Sales and PSF by Developer and Project, 2) Sales Performance by Market Segment across period, 3) Take up rate (Launched units VS Sold Units) and 4) Median PSF by geographical location and individual project.<iframe seamless frameborder="0" src="https://public.tableau.com/profile/jamie.lu2833#!/vizhome/SGPrivateResidentialPropertySales1H2019DemandSupply/SingaporePrivateResidentialPropertySales1H2019DemandvsSupply?:embed=yes&:display_count=yes&:showVizHome=no" width = '1200' height = '850' scrolling='yes' ></iframe>
