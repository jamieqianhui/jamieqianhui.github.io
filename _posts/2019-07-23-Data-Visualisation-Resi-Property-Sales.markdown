Are you looking to buy a private residential property in Singapore and wish to get a sense of the prevailing market conditions? Retrieving public datasets available on URA API reference webpage, I built a dashboard to analyse the **demand and supply for Singapore's Private Residential Property Sales in 1H2019**. Specifically, I dissected the dataset to identify the following trends: 1) Sales Price PSF by Market Segment across period, 2) Take up rate (% percentage of Sold Units versus Total Units Launched for Sale), 3) Median Price PSF by geographical location and individual project and 4) Top 10 Sales Volume and Highest Median Price PSF by Project and District. Click on read more to view the dashboard!
