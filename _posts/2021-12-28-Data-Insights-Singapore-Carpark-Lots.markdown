The weekday off-peak rates can be categorised as 'Low', 'Mid' and 'High', depending on the location of the carpark lot. Places with 'Low' off-peak rate cost less than $2.50 for every 90 min interval. Locations with 'Mid' and 'High' off-peak rates cost between $2.50 to $4.50 and more than $4.50 per 90 min respectively.
