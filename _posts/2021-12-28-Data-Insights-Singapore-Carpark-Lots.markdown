# An analysis on Singapore Carpark lots

## 1: Weekday Peak Rates
Based on the data collected by Sopra Steria on Singapore carpark lots, the average weekday peak rates per 90 mins interval is $3.43 and the median weekday peak rate is $3.00. If you drive to work on a regular basis and have to park your car in the CBD area during peak periods, then be prepared to spend about $12 sgd for an total of 6-hour period without a season pass!  

## 2: Weekday Off-peak Rates
The weekday off-peak rates can be categorised as 'Low', 'Mid' and 'High', depending on the location of the carpark lot. Places with 'Low' off-peak rate cost less than $2.50 for every 90 min interval. Locations with 'Mid' and 'High' off-peak rates cost between $2.50 to $4.50 and more than $4.50 per 90 min respectively. Be sure to check the carpark rates first if you are going to park your car without a season pass for a substantial amount of time!
