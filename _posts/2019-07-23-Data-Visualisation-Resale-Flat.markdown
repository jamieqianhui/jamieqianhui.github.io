Are you looking to buy a public resale flat in Singapore and wish to get a sense of the prevailing market conditions? Retrieving public datasets available on [data.gov.sg][datagov], I built a dashboard to analyse the **Resale Flat Transactions from Q1 1990 to Q1 2021**. Specifically, I dissected the dataset to identify the following trends: 1) Resale Median Price and Transaction Volume by Flat Type across period, 2) Median Resale Price and Transaction Volume by Location (Town), 3) Largest Flat Size given a budget amount (a slider to select your budget amount) and 4) Average age of the flat by geographical location and flat type. Click on read more to view the dashboard!
