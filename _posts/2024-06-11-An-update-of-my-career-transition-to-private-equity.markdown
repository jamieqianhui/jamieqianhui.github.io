It's been awhile since I've updated my blog! Wanted to provide a brief update on my career transition from Data Analytics to Private Equity since Oct 2022. It's not a major transition since I'm still in the real estate space, but I've moved on from a pure "analytics & data" role. Currently taking on a dual function role mainly focused on Asset Management in Asia Pacific with a dotted line reporting to the Portfolio Management - Global Data Analytics function. It's been almost 2 years already and I'm still enjoying my work in Private Equity Real Estate so far!
