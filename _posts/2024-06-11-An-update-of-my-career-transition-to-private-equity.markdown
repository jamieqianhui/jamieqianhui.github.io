It's been awhile since I've updated my blog! Wanted to provide a brief update on my career transition from Data Analytics to Private Equity since Oct 2022. It's not a major transition since I'm still in the real estate space, but I've moved on from a pure "analytics & data" role, taking on a dual function role mainly focused on Asset Management in Asia Pacific with a dotted line reporting to the Global Data Analytics function.

### 1: Weekday Peak Rates
Based on the data collected by Sopra Steria on Singapore carpark lots, the average weekday peak rates per 90 mins interval is $3.43 and the median weekday peak rate is $3.00. If you drive to work on a regular basis and have to park your car in the CBD area during peak periods, then be prepared to spend about $12 sgd for a total of 6-hour period without a season pass at peak rates!  

### 2: Weekday Off-peak Rates
