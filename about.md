## About 
**Hello! Welcome to my blog!** This is a space where I document my learnings, share data analytics concepts and codes, as well as real estate related information with data enthusiasts!

## Summary 

As a full-stack data analyst, I build Extract, Transform & Load (ETL) pipelines, data automation workflows and analytical dashboards for companies using applications of Microsoft, SAP, Tableau and open-source frameworks. Beginning in 2016, I have delivered scalable data-driven projects with a focus on revenue acquisitions, feasibility studies and business process improvement to real estate developers, consulting firms and government agencies. Apart from data stewardship and data science, I am also passionate about making investments in ETFs/Stocks. Running, hiking and practicing yoga are some of the leisure activities which I enjoy during my free time.

> *Data is everywhere. It helps us solve problems and better understand the world. But data itself isn't a solution. It's what people do with it that matters. Data science to me is analyzing information to it's truth, is about using data to solve problems and create as much impact as possible for your company. And finally, the real thing is about how do you apply these data insights in decision making.*
